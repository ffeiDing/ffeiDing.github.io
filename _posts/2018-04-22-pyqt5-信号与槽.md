PyQT is a Python wrapper around the QT GUI application development framework


pyqtsignal必须在类里面定义。   

Qt Designer is the Qt tool for designing and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Qt Widgets. You can compose and customize your windows or dialogs in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) manner, and test them using different styles and resolutions.   
Widgets and forms created with Qt Designer integrate seamlessly with programmed code, using Qt's signals and slots mechanism, so that you can easily assign behavior to graphical elements. All properties set in Qt Designer can be changed dynamically within the code. Furthermore, features like widget promotion and custom plugins allow you to use your own components with Qt Designer.
